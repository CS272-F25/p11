    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>CoHabit is a mobile roommate-management platform designed to streamline shared living by centralizing communication, responsibilities, and financial coordination. Many households rely on ad-hoc systems—group chats, spreadsheets, verbal reminders—that are inefficient and prone to misunderstanding. CoHabit solves this by providing a unified, intuitive interface that helps roommates stay organized, accountable, and connected.</p>

      <h2>Why CoHabit?</h2>
      <p>The app's core features include a Roommate Directory for adding, removing, and managing household members and a Profile System where each user can customize their preferences, contact information, and living habits. CoHabit also integrates smart Notifications for chore reminders, payment deadlines, roommate requests, and schedule updates, reducing the cognitive load of daily coordination.</p>
      <p>To support equitable cost-sharing, CoHabit offers a dedicated Finance Module where users can log expenses, split costs, track outstanding balances, and view historical transactions. This module minimizes financial ambiguity and encourages transparency across the household.</p>
